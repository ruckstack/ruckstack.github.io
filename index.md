# Welcome to Ruckstack

## What is it?

Cloud infrastructures have a lot going for them--isolated and packaged services, monitoring and management, scalability.

BUT: they are not always an option
- Some applications must remain on-prem
- ISVs cannot enforce deployment options
- Kubernetes clusters are complex and difficult to administer
- Cloud provider costs can become high

Ruckstack allows you to package and deploy your entire application stack (whatever it is) in a managed and scalable way
from a single installable file. 

## How does it work?

Ruckstack takes your project, wraps a [k3s](https://k3s.io) based configuration around it, and packages it into a simple to deploy and use system.

For more information, see the [Quick-Start guide](/quickstart).

## Project Status

- Currently in alpha, looking for feedback.

## Roadmap

Lots of exciting things on the horizon

- Multi-machine clustering support
- Smaller artifact sizes
