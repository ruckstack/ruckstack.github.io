title:  "Ruckstack v0.8.1 and v0.8.2 Released"
excerpt: "Bugfix Release"
---

There was an issue with fresh server installs, where they would not start correctly. Definitely worth a patch release.

I also handled a less major problem where the server strangely didn't start on deeply nested paths due to Linux socket filename length limitations.

But, quickly after releasing v0.8.1 with those fixes, I found a problem with how builds on Windows handled path separators so releasing v0.8.2 with that fix in it.
