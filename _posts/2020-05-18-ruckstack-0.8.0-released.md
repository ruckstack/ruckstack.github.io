title:  "Ruckstack v0.8.0 Released"
excerpt: "Status & Logs & More!"
---

The focus for the 0.8.0 release was simplifying system management.

The goal of Ruckstack is to make running Kubernetes easier than running your application on its own.
Yes, there is always kubectl and all it's power, but 90% of your system management should be done through
simpler system-control commands.

With 0.8.0, we've added the first 3 of these:

1. [system-control status](/docs/server/status)
1. [system-control logs](/docs/server/logs)
1. [system-control restart](/docs/server/restart)

### Status

The status command is your first stop when understanding the status of the system.

Are any servers down? Run `system-control status nodes`

```
Nodes in Example Project Cluster
----------------------------------------------------
app1 (10.8.8.65): Healthy
    Primary node
```   

Are any services down? Run `system-control status services`


```
Services in Example Project
----------------------------------------------------
Application Services
----------------------------------------------------
cart: HEALTHY
 - Container cart-s4492 on app1: Running
homepage: HEALTHY
 - Container homepage-fx7jm on app1: Running
mariadb-primary: UNAVAILABLE. No containers are ready
 - Container mariadb-primary-0 on app1: Starting
mariadb-backup: UNAVAILABLE. No containers are ready
 - Container mariadb-backup-0 on app1: Starting
```
### Logs

Something not working right? Run `system-control logs service cart`

### Restart

Is a container or service stuck in a bad state that the health monitoring isn't handling? Run `system-control restart container cart-s4492`
