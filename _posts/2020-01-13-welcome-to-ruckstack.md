title:  "Welcome to Ruckstack"
---

I've spent a good portion of my life dealing with getting my software installed into other people's environments and it is **never** easy.

Different technology stacks and patterns have come and gone over the years with varying levels of success, but they have all had their weaknesses.

AWS is a great solution to many of those problems, but unfortunately too many of my customers require the software to be installed on-prem 
and/or in Azure and/or on Google Cloud and/or on any number of other infrastructures for me to consistently deliver my software using any of those tools.   

Some are technology-specific. Some require cloud-provider lock-in. Some are overly complex. Some are only half a solution.

On top of all that, there are *always* surprises in what else is installed on the server, network configurations, and other environmental problems.

Ruckstack is my attempt to solve that problem so *YOU* can focus on *YOUR* software and *NOT* your installation and management.
