title:  "Ruckstack v0.8.1 Released"
excerpt: "Bugfix Release"
---

There was an issue with fresh server installs, where they would not start correctly. Definitely worth a patch release.

We also handled a less major problem where the server strangely didn't start on deeply nested paths due to Linux socket filename length limitations.
