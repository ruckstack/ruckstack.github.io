title:  "Ruckstack v0.7.0 Released"
excerpt: "Now with clustering!"
---

The focus for the 0.7.0 release was clustering support.

To add a new server to the cluster:

1. Copy your installer to the new machine and run it. 
1. When asked if you want to join an existing cluster, say "Y"
1. The installer will prompt you for a join token
1. On the existing server, run `system-control cluster add-node` which will give you a token which you copy/paste into the new server's install prompt
1. Finish install and enjoy your new-found capacity!

For more information, see the [clustering documentation](/docs/server/clustering)
