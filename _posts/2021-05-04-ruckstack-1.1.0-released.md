title:  "Ruckstack v1.1.0 Released"
excerpt: "Dev + Ops"
---

With Ruckstack 1.1, we are introducing two new capabilities to your Ruckstack-packaged applications:
1. Dev Mode
1. Ops Application

### Dev Mode

Dev Mode is designed to make development and testing of your systems easier. 

It is modeled after the "developer options" found in Android and other systems, which allow you to reconfigure 
an installed system to enable tools to help with creating and debugging your application.

For 1.1, we introduced the ability to reroute requests for specific services to external locations (normally your development environment).

Future versions will add more "dev mode" features. For more information, see [our dev mode docs](/docs/server/dev-mode).

### Ops Application

Getting your software onto your customer's systems is just the first battle. The real war is managing it.

Your Ruckstack-packaged application includes a dedicated management system available at `http(s)://your-server/ops`.

The default ops page is a publicly available "status" page to help your customers know if there are problems with the system
and provides them with your contact information.

[Pro users](/pro) are able to log into the ops application for more detailed information on the status as well as get access to 
component-specific management applications such as the Kubernetes dashboard.

Future versions will add far more features to the ops application. For more information, see [the ops docs](/docs/server/ops).
