Application management and orchestration is complex and difficult, but there are great tools out there to use.

Ruckstack pulls together industry-leading technologies to provide you with a stable and powerful system.

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) via the [K3S project](https://k3s.io/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh) packaging
- [Containerd](https://containerd.io/) runtime   

## Best Practices

Unfortunately, those tools can be complex to implement and manage. 
Especially because they are generally targeted at datacenter managers running hundreads of apps on thousands of computers--not one app running on a handful of servers.

Ruckstack takes the guesswork and mistakes out by [building in the configuration and best practices](/design) needed to run these powerful tools safely.
