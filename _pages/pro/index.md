No matter which edition you are going to run, install the same software from [the download page](/download).



## Ruckstack Starter

**Price: Free!**

The Starter edition comes with everything you need to package, deploy, and run your application.

Support is available via standard open-source community channels such as [github.com/ruckstack/ruckstack](https://github.com/ruckstack/ruckstack) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruckstack).

## Ruckstack Pro

**Price: $99/developer per year**

The Pro edition builds on the Starter version by also providing you with the tools you need to succeed.

Currently, this means we provide premium support but soon will also be adding additional functionality such as advanced monitoring and troubleshooting and more.
