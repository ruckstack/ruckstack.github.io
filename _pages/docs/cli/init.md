## Overview

When first starting a new Ruckstack project, run `ruckstack init` to create all needed files in the given directory.

By default, it will create a blank project, but other templates can be specified as well.

#### Optional Fields

| \--template | Project template to use. Defaults "empty", but can also be set to "example" or "wordpress" for a more complete example project. | 
| \--out | Directory to create the project in. Defaults to the current directory. |
{: .flag-table}
